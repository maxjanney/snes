Memory Map
    - 24bit address bus (000000h-FFFFFFh)
    - divided into 8 bit bank plus a 16 bit offset 
        - some banks are broken into two 32 Kbyte halves (0000h-7FFFh=System Area, 8000h-FFFFh=Cartridge ROM)
    - memory is divided into WS1 and WS2, which can be configured to have different wait states

Addressing Modes
    - Absolute
        - the second and thrid bytes of the instruction form the LOW 16 bits 
          of the EFFECTIVE address. the Data Bank Register contains the high order 
          8 bits of the operand address 
    - Absolute Indexed Indirect (a,x)
        - the second and thrid bytes of the instruction are added with the 
          X register to a form a 16 bit pointer into bank 0. The data bank reg.
          contains the high order 8 bits of the effective address
